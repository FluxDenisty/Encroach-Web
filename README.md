#Encroach-Web
##About
This is the HTML5 implimentation of the game *Encroach* orginially written in Java by Dmitri Blotsky and myself.
This project was started at SEhackday on Friday May 27 2011.
The basic goal of the game is to take over the entire board.
You accomplish this by changing the colour of squares you own to match and take over surrounding ones.
Some games follow this same basis but Encroach is unique in it's multiplayer aspect.

##Future
The end-goal for this game is to have a polished and multi-mode game.
Mode changes will include ai, player number, and fill mode changes.
The game will stop being developed when people stop thinking of cool things to add to it.
